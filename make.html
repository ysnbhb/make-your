        <p>
          In a faraway world, where parallel dimensions converge and mysterious
          forces harmonize, there existed a creature named "Vizarion," an
          ancient guardian of the universe's core energy source. This source,
          known as the "Eternal Crystal,"
          However, one fateful day, a cosmic attack shattered this source,
          causing the crystal to break into small fragments scattered across
          various realms. As the fragments spread across distant places in
          space, Vizarion could no longer bear the chaos. He decided to use his
          powers to retrieve each missing piece of the crystal and return them
          to their rightful place. But there was a great challenge ahead:
          mysterious brick barriers stood in his way, preventing him from
          reaching the crystal pieces. This is where your journey begins! You
          are the hero controlling the "Silver Beam," a being that guides the
          ball through the obstacles in its path. Your task is to destroy these
          barriers, collect the fragments, and reassemble the Eternal Crystal to
          restore balance to the universe before time runs out. As you progress
          through the levels, you'll face more complex barriers and stronger
          enemies. With each new level, you'll uncover new elements to aid your
          journey. üîµ Show ball ‚û°Ô∏è‚Äã Move left ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚Äã Move right üü¶‚Äã Brick
