      <h1>Hello player</h1>
        <p>
          In a faraway world, where parallel dimensions converge and mysterious
          forces harmonize, there existed a creature named "Vizarion," an
          ancient guardian of the universe's core energy source. This source,
          known as the "Eternal Crystal," However, one fateful day, a cosmic
          attack shattered this source, causing the crystal to break into small
          fragments scattered across various realms. As the fragments spread
          across distant places in space, Vizarion could no longer bear the
          chaos. He decided to use his powers to retrieve each missing piece of
          the crystal and return them to their rightful place. But there was a
          great challenge ahead: mysterious brick barriers stood in his way,
          preventing him from reaching the crystal pieces. This is where your
          journey begins! You are the hero controlling the "Silver Beam," a
          being that guides the ball through the obstacles in its path. Your
          task is to destroy these barriers, collect the fragments, and
          reassemble the Eternal Crystal to restore balance to the universe
          before time runs out. As you progress through the levels, you'll face
          more complex barriers and stronger enemies. With each new level,
          you'll uncover new elements to aid your journey. üîµ Show ball ‚û°Ô∏è‚Äã Move
